### Running Jupyter notebooks.
1. Clone this repo https://github.com/Davidpurtill1101011/Emerging_Technologies_4th_Year
2. If you do not have Anaconda installed for Windows/Mac use this link https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and you can install it. 
3. Command to install Jupyter: **python -m pip install --user jupyter** this should then be able to show you my Jupyter Notebooks.
4. Next you need to change directory to the Assessment folder that is where all the work i have done for the assessment this command should help you: **cd assessment** . 
5. To run the Jupyter notebooks you need get a clone of this repo, And when you have this repo cloned down to your machine you need to go into that directory and if on Windows or Mac you will need to open the Command Prompt/Terminal and run the following command: **Jupyter Notebook**.

### About this Project
This assessment is given to us (the students) to show how capable we are of actually going away and learning some of the notebooks ourselves and getting to grips with the tutorials. And learning how the machine learning side of Python such as Pandas can actually be used to do some of the mundane stuff such as drawing diagrams and processing the data that is given to it.

### Scikit-Learn
Done a tutorial on datasets and did some mapping on a graph using mathplotlib again like we used in the numpy-random and more notes can be found on that by using the **numpy** link below.
Here is some shorcuts to use with [SciKit Learn commands](https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330) for the keyboard that are really handy and can help navigate the notebook easier.

### K-Nearest Neighbor
K-Nearest Neighbor is a supervised learning algorithm (**Supervised** means that it is learning the link between 2 datasets), one being observed data and the second being the external data that we try to have the algorithm predict which in turn is called the "target" or "label". Usually you would use **y** as the name and it would be a 1D array to store the data that is entered.

### Color Quantization using K-Means
is a algotithm that uses un-supervised learning and group the similar objects together, it can also reduce the amount of storage need for the image. You must turn parts of the images into k-clusters which will be broken up for **RGB**. When using this the images arent read in as an image they are read in as an array, but not all pixels are read in as there would be to many it picks certain pixels and adds them to an array and then forms the image that way
